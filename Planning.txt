habit = {
  habitName: "Exercise", // Replace with your habit name
  startDate: "2023-09-18", // Replace with the start date
  rep: repeatition per day;
  daysCompleted: {
    "2023-09-18": true,  // Replace with the actual date and initial completion status
    "2023-09-19": false, // Replace with the actual date and initial completion status
    // Add more dates and completion status as needed
	OR I just add the day complete into this array instead of including both fail and pass day
  },	
markCompleted(date) {
    this.daysCompleted[date] = true;
  },
markIncomplete(date) {
    this.daysCompleted[date] = false;
  },
isCompleted(date) {
    return this.daysCompleted[date] || false;
  },

habits are the array of all habit

To do tracklist:

A list that show progress in the current week 
A list that show progress in the pass week
A list that show progress in the pass month -- will need update in the future, maybe after learning NodeJs
add streak

*** Begin of new week, or Monday, will delete the data from two weeks ago
